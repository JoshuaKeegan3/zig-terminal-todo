# Todo List
This is a project that I am actually using and will likely get updates. This only works on MacOs when the persistance files are in the expected place. This would have to be changed in code. Sorry this was made for me :)

The project takes a flag. If the flag is b then it will not enter the gui mode and will just print the list.
